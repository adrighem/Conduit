# Tech Stack

## Application
- Rust 2021.
- GTK4, libadwaita, and WebKitGTK 6 for the desktop UI.
- Tokio's multi-threaded runtime for concurrent background I/O, with asynchronous channels delivering events to GTK's main loop.

## Slack Integration
- `reqwest` with rustls for Slack Web API requests.
- Slack OAuth PKCE user-token flow through `oauth.v2.user.access`.
- Slack API calls validated with `auth.test`.
- Keyring-backed token storage through Secret Service.

## Build and Test
- Cargo for Rust dependency management and unit tests.
- Meson/Ninja for GNOME build integration and resources.
- `cargo test` and `meson test -C _build` are supported validation commands.

## Local State
- XDG cache paths under the application ID for WebKit data, image assets, and Slack state caches.
